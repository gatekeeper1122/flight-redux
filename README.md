# FlightRedux  
A LUA script for the Stand mod menu that completely revamps GTA V's flight hud.

## So.. how do I use this?  
Get in a plane and turn it on!  
  
The only toggle in this is **GPWS**, standing for Ground Proximity Warning System. This will alert you "TERRAIN PULL UP" if you are too close to the ground (< 50 in altitude), or if your sink rate is too fast (you are descending too quickly).  
ALT is your altitute  
KNTS is your speed in knots  

The circle with the 3 lines sticking out of it marks your trajectory (where your plane is actually heading in the direction of; it's not just the center of the screen or your reticle). The other thing that looks like a crosshair is your boresight, which is where your guns are projected to hit (basically, your crosshair now).  

MISSILE is alerting you that there is a missile behind you/one being fired by you.  
FIRE is alerting you that, well, your plane is on fire.  
MASTER WARN alerts you that your plane has sustained a lot of damage (this usually doesn't come on).  
SINK RATE means you are descending too quickly (toggle off GPWS to turn this off).  
TERRAIN PULL UP is self-explanatory (toggle off GPWS or put your gear down to turn this off).  
  
At the very bottom left of the screen you will see a number and your armanent mode.  
GUN means the "explosive bullets" armanent is selected.  
RKT is homing rocket.  
RKT (NH) is non-homing rocket.  
The number above the armanent setting is your plane's estimated max speed, in knts. 

MACH 1 is how many times the speed of sound you are travelling. This IS actually dynamic, the thing is no plane in GTA V can hit mach 2 unless you use vehicle fly or something.  
  
Also your HUD will mark all nearby vehicles, and when you lock onto stuff it will draw a line from the center of your screen to the locked-on target.  
  
The HUD here is mostly fictional, but is based mainly off the F16's hud. All of the concepts illustrated in the HUD are real where they can be, and converted to GTA-ness where necessary.  
  
  
## Compatibility 
This script was designed for the Lazer specifically. Although it should work for every aircraft, some inconsistencies may be noticed. The only consistency I am aware of right off the bat is the armanent setting (at the very bottom left) not being accurate. Other than that everything else should work pretty universally.  

Enjoy!
